# Angular Udemy Big Project: Shopping List/Recipe App
This is the large project done throughout the course of the Udemy Angular class, where pieces were added on gradually as we learned more about different features of Angular to practice putting them all together.

Two main sections are a part of this app: Recipes and Shopping List.

- Recipes: The user can add, edit, and delete recipes from a list, where the recipes store the name, list of ingredients, and other details. A button also allows for sending all ingredients for a recipe over to the shopping list automatically.
- Shopping List: The user can add, edit, and delete ingredients from a list, where each ingredient has a name and number they need to buy from the store.

Practice using both the Template driven and Reactive approaches for forms by using template driven in the shopping list editing section and the reactive version for recipe editing.
